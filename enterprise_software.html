	<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>CRM</em></strong></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">CRM or Customer Relationship Management is a system for  managing a company&rsquo;s interactions with current and future customers. It often  involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales,  marketing, customer service, and technical support. <br>
      CRM software allows a business build a relationship with customers by  automating communications with them. It gives customers the feeling of personal  services. A good CRM system gathers info from lots of sources across the  business and beyond. The business gets insights into how customers feel and  what they are saying about the business. <br>
      Moving CRM to the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; has dramatically increased its usefulness. It is  argued &ldquo;Cloud-based CRM systems such as Salesforce mean every user has the same  Info, all the time. Your sales force out on the road can check data, update it  instantly after a meeting or work from anywhere. The same info is available to  anyone who needs it, from the sales team to the customer service representative&rdquo;.<br>
