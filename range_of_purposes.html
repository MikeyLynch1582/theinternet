	<p class="MsoNormal">There are range of many different purposes on the internet  to use. These are communication, research, collaboration and e-commerce. In  this section we will investigate voice and written communication under the  communication heading, information search under research heading, file  downloading and sharing under collaboration heading and e-commerce under the  e-commerce heading.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>Communication</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Voice  Communication</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.0pt;">We have three different uses of  the internet in voice communication. These are audio conferencing, video  conferencing and VoIP.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Audio Conferencing</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">Audio conferencing is a  connection between two computers that requires participants to have a  microphone and speakers. Using an instant messaging program, such as America  Online Messenger (AOL), or an audio-conferencing software, such as Skype or  Zoom, users speak into a microphone and the dialogue is heard through the  speakers of the other users.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><u>Video/Web Conferencing</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">Video Conferencing works much  like audio conferencing. The differences are that the users are able to see  each other and for this a webcam is needed by all parties. Depending upon the  service used, multiple people can see and be seen at the same time. Examples of  this are; Cisco, Microsoft Teams and Zoom.</p>
		
	<img class = "middle" src="images/microsoft-teams-logo-2.png" width="850" height="300" alt=""/>
    <ul>
      <li><u>VoIP</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">Video over Internet Protocol  (VoIP), is phone service through an internet connection. Users are given an  adapter and a unique phone number. The user can then send and receive phone  calls using a computer, a VoIP phone or a traditional phone, to and from other  people, whether or not they use a VoIP connection themselves. Examples of this  are; Blueface and Skype.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Written  Communication</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:18.0pt;">There are four uses of written  communication on the internet. These are: E-mail, Instant Messaging, IRC and  SMS + Wireless communications.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Email</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">E-mail is a transmission of  messages over communications networks. The messages can be notes entered from a  keyboard or electronic files stored on disk. Most mainframes, minicomputers and  computer networks have an e-mail system. Some e-mail systems are confined to a  single computer system or network, but others have gateways to other computer  systems, enabling you to send e-mail anywhere in the world.<br>
      Using an email client (software such as Microsoft Outlook and Eudora), you can  compose an e-mail message and send it to another person anywhere, as long as  you know the recipient e-mail address. I usually only takes a few seconds for  the email to arrive at the destination. <br>
      one of the downfalls of email is spam. Spam is a form of junk mail which  normally represents a product on sale, and this email is normally sent in  thousand if not millions. Sometimes, these can contain viruses which can affect  your computer. For this reason, you should invest in anti-virus software. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Instant Messaging</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">One of the fastest growing forms  of internet communication is instant messaging. Instant messaging is a text-based  computer text chain between two or more people. Instant messaging systems  normally notify you whenever somebody contacts you.<br>
      One reason the instant messaging has become so popular is its real-time nature.  Unlike e-mail, where you will wait for the person to check the email and send a  reply, if a person you want to reach is online and available in your contacts,  your message appears instantly inÂ  a  window on their screen.<br>
      While instant messaging is used by millions of internet users to contact family  and friends, it&rsquo;s also growing in popularity in the business world. Employees  of a company can have instant access to managers and co-workers in different offices  or locations and can eliminate the need to place phone calls when info is  required immediately. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>IRC</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">Internet Relay Chat (IRC), is a  multi-user chat system that allows people to gather on &ldquo;channels&rdquo; or &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; to  talk in groups or in private. IRC is based on a client/server model. That is,  to join an IRC discussion, you need an IRC client and internet access. The IRC  client is a program that runs on your computer and sends and receives messages  to and from an IRC server. The IRC server, in turn, is responsible for making  sure that all messages are broadcasted to everyone in the discussion. With many  IRC clients you can easily create your own chatroom and invite others to join  your channel. You can also protect channels by adding a password to the  chatroom.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>SMS &amp; Wireless Communications</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">Short message service (SMS), is a  global wireless service that enables the transmission of alphanumeric messages  between mobile subscribers and external systems such as e-mail, paging and  voice-mail systems. Messages can be no longer than 160 alpha-numeric characters  and must contain no images or graphics. Once a message is sent, it is received  by a Short Message Service Centre, which must then get it to the appropriate  mobile device or system. As wireless services evolved, Multimedia Messaging  Service was introduced and provided a way to send messages comprising a combination  of text, sounds, images and video to multimedia messaging service users.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><strong><em>Research</em></strong></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">There are many building blocks to  make up the research aspect of the internet. These all interlink with each  other to help users find info to research up on. Some of the cogs that help the  research machine are web browsers, URL, hyperlinks</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">The internet is made up of web  browsers that make it easier to access information that you need to find. Some  of the most popular ones are, Firefox, Google, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge  and Internet Explorer Within these browsers we can type in keywords into a  search bar to find relevant websites or we can type in URL&rsquo;s that we know will  bring us to a certain website. Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the global  address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. The first part  of the address is called a protocol identifier and it indicates what protocol  to use, and the second part is called a resource name and it specifies the IP  address or the domain name where the resource is located. The protocol  identifier and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward  slashes.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">If you look up information  through keywords the search will bring up hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are an element  in an electronic document that links to another place in the same document or  to an entirely different document. Typically, you click on the hyperlink to  follow the link.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">All these elements make it easier  for the user to find the information they need.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;"><strong><em>Collaboration</em></strong></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">There are two different types of collaboration to use on the  internet. These are File Sharing, File Downloading.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>File sharing</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">File sharing is the public or  private sharing of computer data or space in a network with various levels of  access. While files can easily be shared outside the network, the term file  sharing almost always means sharing files in a network, even if in small local  area network.<br>
      File sharing allows several people to use the same file or file by some  combination of being able to read or view it, write to or modify it, copy it,  or print it. Typically, a file sharing system has one or more administrators.  Users may all have the same or may have different levels of access privilege.  File sharing can also mean having an allocated amount of personal file storage  in a common file system.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>File downloading</u></li>
      <li>Peer-To-Peer Downloading</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;">Users can use software that  connects in to a peer-to-peer network to search for shared files on the  computers of other users connected to the network. Files of interest can then  be downloaded directly from other users on the network. Typically, large files  are broken down into smaller chunks, which mat be obtained from multiple peers  an then reassembled by the downloader. This is done while the peer is  simultaneously uploading the chunks it already has to other peers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>File Hosting Services</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;">File hosting services are a  simple alternative to peer-to-peer software. These are sometimes used together  with internet collaboration tools such as email, forums, blogs, or any other  medium in which links to direct downloads from file hosting service can be  embedded. These sites typically host files so that others can download them.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>File Sync and Sharing</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:54.0pt;">Cloud-based file syncing and  sharing services implement automated file transfers by updating files from  dedicated sharing directory on each user&rsquo;s networked devices.<br>
      Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and  mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or  collaboration.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><em>E-Commerce</em></strong></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:36.0pt;">E-Commerce is the buying and  selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an  electronic network, primarily the internet. These business transactions occur  either as business-to-business, business-to-consumer or consumer-to-business. </p>
